ShopEZ ensures authenticity and trust by allowing only verified buyers to submit product reviews. Users can post feedback and ratings only after purchasing the product, preventing fake or misleading reviews. This feature enhances credibility and helps customers make informed purchasing decisions.

2. Instant Stock Validation and Auto-Control:

Each order in ShopEZ generates a unique custom order number in the format (ORD-YYYY-####). This structured tracking system allows users and administrators to easily identify, manage, and track orders efficiently.

5. Advanced Multi-Level Product Filtering:
ShopEZ offers an intelligent filtering system that allows users to search products based on category, price range, and sorting preferences such as newest first or price-based sorting. This improves navigation and helps users quickly find relevant products.

6. Smart Category-Based Homepage Experience:
The homepage of ShopEZ is structured into multiple product sections based on categories along with a featured products section. This organized layout enhances browsing experience and ensures users can easily explore different product segments.
